        <p> Sometimes there are super weird thoughts that run wild in my head. I never say them out loud, because let's be real, if I did I'd be committed. <br> 
        Don't let that frighten you, though. I know how to control what comes out and what stays in. Who knows how long I can maintain said control. I guess we will see. <br>
